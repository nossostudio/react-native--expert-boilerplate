# react-native--expert-boilerplate
It comes with most important rn packages for developing apps.\nIt's based on Expo v35, react-navigation, jest (unit test - TDD), redux (global state manager), redux-form, etc.

If you need a quickstart for developing a new app, feel free to use our boilerplate.

## Redux and Redux-Form
Redux is used as data storage. It abstracts a database. Redux is a famous paradigm and can be used in other frameworks, like flutter, wordpress, etc.
If you are not familiar with Redux, please refer to this link.

## React-Navigation 
React-Navigation is a powerful native solution for app navigations. It suports native behavior on both iOS and Android apps. It suports a good range of navigators: Stack, Tabbar, Drawer, etc.

## Expo 
Expo is a framework built on top of react-native. It makes developing react-native apps much easier. 

## Jest
TDD stands for Test-driven Development. Jest is a node package for creating tests for your code. It comes with 5 unit tests.
Run ```npm test``` inside the project to try it out.

## ESLint
ESLint is a tool for finding (and fixing) potencial problems in your code.
Before any commit, or after every new feature, you should run ```npm run eslint``` inside the project folder for fixing your code.

## NanoId
It is a tiny package for generating ids for items in your list of objects. You know, json/redux/noSQL structure does not really have autoincremented ids.

## Typescript (optional)
If you prefer pure ECMAScript (Javascript), do not worry, you just need to create ```.js``` files instead of ```.ts```.
Typescript is a programming language made on top of Javascript. It offers typed primitive variables and objects. It is a typed programming language.
But in the end, Typescript is transpiled (converted) to pure Javascript.
